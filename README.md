## Installation
The project required mysql, node, inquirer, and mysql2.  Once the repsitory is cloned, mysql needs to be run in the database folder and the 'schema.sql' and 'seeds.sql' files need to be SOURCED.  Then the user needs to perform an "npm install" to install the dependencies that are required to run the application.  Finally, the command "node index.js" will run the file.

## Usage
The program does all the sql queries so a user need only answer the questions asked in the command-line interface.  Here is a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SekgI9xepSnxASSf8bYmcfLl-3Finr-p/view?usp=sharing) displaying how it works.
